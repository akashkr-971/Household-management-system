# Mini-project
college mini-project  :  Household management system

This is a mini-project that i have done for my college 6th semester. 
This project is developed using html,css,javascript as front-end and django a python based framework for the back-end.
This system is developed for customers who is in need for any household activivtes like plumbing,electrician,carpenter,interior designer and other activites.
In real life we used to call the service providers for what service we need and if they are busy or have other works our project will be delayed so to avoid that i have developed this system.
Using this system a customer can check if there are any service providers for their required services and also get a snapshot about how much they usually cost regarding the parts they need to purchase and select from multiple service providers according to their ratings.
By developig this project i aim to make the customers job of selecting a service providerrs easier in a usser friendly manner
