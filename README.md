# Household Management System  

This project is a **mini-project** developed for my 6th semester in college. It is designed to simplify household service management for customers, allowing them to find and book service providers efficiently.  

## Overview  

The **Household Management System** is a web application built using:  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: Django (a Python-based framework)  

This system caters to customers seeking household services like:  
- Plumbing  
- Electrical work  
- Carpentry  
- Interior design  
- Other similar activities  

## Purpose  

In real life, customers often face delays when calling service providers directly, as they may already be occupied with other tasks. This project aims to solve that problem by providing an intuitive platform where customers can:  
- Search for available service providers for their required services.  
- Compare service providers based on their ratings.  
- Get an estimate of costs, including parts that might need to be purchased.  

The goal is to make the process of finding and selecting service providers **easier and more user-friendly**.  

## Features  

- **Service Availability Check**: Customers can see which service providers are available for their desired service.  
- **Rating-Based Selection**: Allows customers to choose service providers based on ratings and reviews.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to ensure smooth navigation and usability.  

## Benefits  

- Eliminates the hassle of contacting service providers individually.  
- Saves time by offering multiple options in one place.  
- Helps customers make informed decisions with ratings and cost insights.
